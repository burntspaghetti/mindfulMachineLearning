mml
 
Goal:
 
The goal of mml is to provide a private meta psychological analysis of one's thoughts and actions over time by running Natural Language Processing on encrypted daily journal entries in order to help users become more mindful about the positive and negative things in their lives.
 
requirements:
 
1. users need to be able to record their daily thoughts and actions in an encrypted database
 
2. run NLP on daily journal entries to get meta psychological analysis over time (weekly, monthly, yearly trends in different emotions)
 
Reports/ideas

emotional analysis - level of emotions (joy, anger, disgust, sadness, fear)

Run targeted emotional analysis on certain keywords that bring the most joy, and the most anger etc.

what questions should be asked????
------------------------------------
What activities did you do?
 
What did you eat/drink?
 
Did you exercise? How long? What type?
 
How much sunlight did you get? (dropdown)
 
How did you sleep last night? (dropdown)
 
Did you dream? If so, describe the dream. (check box + text area)
 
What social interactions did you have?
 
Describe the day as a whole? What was on your mind?
 
What were the top 5 things on your mind? (5 different text boxes) Describe each of these things
 
Rate on a scale of 1 - 10 how you felt today
 
What bothered you?
 
What are you worried about?
 
What made you happy?
 
What are you thankful for?
 
What is something you want to change?
 
-------------------------------------------------------------
Problems: 


How to correlate what it is that made things go up and down?
 
 
BIG PROBLEM: feeding this text input into a machine learning api will make it no longer private...how could this be run locally?
